# Terms
In general, no matter the license my basic terms for using this is just to be polite. My goal is to make a game people can contribute to or modify. The main things I ask are: Disclose Source, Try to follow license, Credit Work, Ask before using in a Commerical Project, and [Fair Use](#fair-use).

# Fair Use
Basically, don't use it in illegal or innapropriate ways, such as promoting illegal or graphic content.
