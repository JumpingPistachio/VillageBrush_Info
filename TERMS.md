# Terms
In general, no matter the license my basic terms for using this is just to be polite. My goal is to make a game people can contribute to or modify. The main thing I ask is to disclose the source and use it [Fairly](#fair-use)

# Fair Use
Basically, don't use it in illegal or innapropriate ways, such as promoting illegal or graphic content.
