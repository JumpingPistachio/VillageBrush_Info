This repository is to store Assets, Todo Lists, Info, Maybe Devlog style Blogs (?), etc.

# About
My goal for VillageBrush is to be a simple yet fun City/Town builder game. There is no win or lose in the game, and money management isn't the main concern. The only real goal in the game is to build whatever you want.
