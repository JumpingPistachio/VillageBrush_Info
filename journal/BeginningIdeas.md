# Beginning Ideas
- 2D or 3D
	- Pros
    	- 3D is easier to work with at angles
    	- 3D allows for a more real feel
    	- 2D is easier to make
    - Cons
		- 3D is more difficult to make
		- Importing 3D is a bit more confusing
		- 2D becomes difficult to use at angles, angling / rotating stuff is important for a city builder
		- 2D is a little less straightforward
	- Conclusion
		- I think I should use 3D, because it can be rotated, because a city builder feels liek it should be 3D, and because I want to learn Blender 3D.
